# workflows module

This folder owns server/domain logic for the **workflows** feature area.

- Workflows: templates, run configs, mapping to orchestrator jobs.
- Captures: capture ingest/transcription mapping into jobs + library items.
- Library: search+index logic, item schemas, and storage helpers.

UI surfaces live under \pp/(dashboard)/workflows\.
