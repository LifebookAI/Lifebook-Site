--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Phase 0 — Infra | orchestrator_e2e_smoke_ci |  | ✔ | - Added orchestrator queue health + DLQ inspector/drainer scripts - Drained synthetic scheduler messages from lifebook-orchestrator-queue-dlq - Ran orchestrator E2E synthetic smoke (SQS→worker→S3) successfully - Wired orchestrator-e2e-smoke GitHub Actions workflow (OIDC) for PRs |  |  | Mark orchestrator-e2e-smoke check as required on main and run it on the next PR. | Zach | 
Phase 0 — Infra | orchestrator_queues.cw_alarms |  | ✔ | - Created infra/orchestrator/orchestrator-queue-alarms.ps1 (idempotent SQS CW alarms tool) - Upserted alarms for main queue backlog, oldest age, and DLQ non-empty - Wired all three alarms to lifebook-alerts SNS and tagged with Project=lifebook, Env=prod, Component=orchestrator… |  |  | Exercise alarms with a small synthetic backlog/DLQ message to confirm lifebook-alerts notifications fire as expected. | Zach | 
Phase 0 — Infra | orchestrator_queues.cw_alarms_exercised |  | ✔ | - Used cloudwatch set-alarm-state on three orchestrator SQS alarms - Forced visible backlog, oldest age, and DLQ alarms into ALARM state - Confirmed alarm state + timestamps via cloudwatch describe-alarms - Verified lifebook-alerts SNS wiring by expecting/observing email notif… |  |  | Let alarms return to steady-state (INSUFFICIENT_DATA/OK), then rely on natural backlog/DLQ behavior to drive alerts during real traffic. | Zach |
